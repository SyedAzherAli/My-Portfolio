            Hi, I am <span className="purple">Syed Azher Ali </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Hyderabad, India.</span>
            <br />
            I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and have developed a strong foundation in DevOps principles and cloud technologies. 
            <br />
            My passion lies in automating workflows, ensuring smooth CI/CD pipelines, and building scalable infrastructure that enhances application reliability and performance.
            <br />
            Currently, I am focused on mastering tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and monitoring platforms like Prometheus and Grafana. 
            <br />
            Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring advanced cloud services provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP to create efficient and cost-effective solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding and automation, I love:
